        <h2>Why it’s important to know your skin type</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Your skin falls into one of four main categories: oily, combination, dry, or sensitive. Each type has unique characteristics and responds differently to environmental factors. Because skincare ingredients can benefit some skin types while potentially harming others, it’s essential to understand what works best for your skin and what doesn’t.</p>

    <h2>How to care for oily Skin</h2>
    <img  src="images\oily.jpg">
    <p>
    Oily skin overproduces an oily, waxy substance
    called sebum. Oily skin can be acne-prone, as pollutants and dead skin cells<br> 
    could mix with the sebum and clog the skin’s pores which is the
    most common cause for pimples to appear.
    Here is a<br> skincare routine which focuses on
    reducing oily skin’s sebum production while
    keeping it healthy and moisturized.
 </p>

 <div class="points">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>Cleanse Your face up to twice a day with an exfoliating foaming cleanser</span>
            <p>Look for a cleanser containing salicylic acid. It works by exfoliating the skin and unclogging pores. Salicylic acid also has anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce redness and swelling associated with acne. If you’re prone to acne, look for a facial cleanser that contains salicylic acid.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use an alcohol-free exfoliating toner to get rid of dead skin cells</span>
            <p>Lactic acid is an exfoliating alpha-hydroxy acid that helps promote the shedding of dead skin cells. By gently eliminating the build-up of dead cells, this ingredient helps soften and smooth your skin and improve its overall texture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Apply a lightweight, water-based moisturizer</span>
            <p>Make sure the moisturizer is oil-free and non-comedogenic in order to avoid getting clogged pores. Glycerin is a great ingredient to look for, as it’s a humectant, which means it helps to draw moisture into the skin.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Make sure to apply sunscreen every 3 hours when outdoors</span>
            <p>Applying sunscreen frequently prevents sun damage that could lead to wrinkles, age spots, and even skin cancer. Use a lightweight, non-greasy, mineral sunscreen containing zinc oxide, an ingredient that reflects and scatters the sun’s UV rays while absorbing the skin’s oil. Make sure the sunscreen contains SPF 50+.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to care for combination Skin</h2>
    <img src="images\combination.jpg">
    <p>
    Having a combination skin type means that you
    have oily areas on your face such as your
    forehead, nose, and chin, but<br> also some dry
    areas such as your cheeks. Dealing with this skin
    type requires a balance between using products
    for oily <br>skin and dry skin. Here is a skincare 
    routine which focuses on minimizing oiliness
    and dry patches to get a strong, well<br> nourished skin 
    barrier!
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="points">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>Cleanse your face up to twice a day with an exfoliating foaming cleanser</span>
            <p>Cleansers containing mandelic acid are great for combination skin. Mandelic acid is a gentler exfoliant compared to salicylic acid. It helps promote hydration and firmness of the skin while gently getting rid of dead skin cells.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use a niacinamide serum on oily areas of the face</span>
            <p>Niacinamide helps build keratin, a protein that maintains skin health. It’s also been shown to make your skin stronger, smoother, and brighter. Applying a niacinamide serum to oily areas on the face helps control the oiliness and texture of the skin.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use a retinol serum</span>
            <p>Retinol increases skin cell production (proliferation). It helps unclog pores, exfoliates your skin, and increases collagen production. This can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, giving your skin a fresher, plump appearance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use a moisturizer containing ceramides</span>
            <p>Ceramides are naturally occurring lipids in the skin that help to keep it hydrated and protected. Ceramides prevent skin dryness and irritation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use a non-greasy SPF50+ sunscreen every 3 hours when outdoors</span>
            <p>Combination skin can be prone to hyperpigmentation. To prevent dark sun spots from appearing, make sure to apply enough sunscreen throughout the day.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

 <div class="care">
    <h2>How to care for dry skin</h2>
    <img class="dryimg" src="images\dry.jpg">
    <p>
    Dry skin makes the skin look and feel rough,
    itchy, flaky or scaly. The location where these
    dry patches form vary from person<br> to person. 
    Dry skin can get irritated easily which makes 
    your skin feel lots of discomfort when it doesn’t 
    have enough moisture,<br> which is why focusing
    on moisturizing ingredients is key when dealing 
    with dry skin.  Here is a skincare routine which 
    focuses<br> on minimizing oiliness and dry patches 
    to get a strong, well nourished skin barrier!
</p>
 </div>
 <div class="points">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>Cleanse twice a day with an oil cleanser</span>
            <p>Oil cleansers are formulated with lightweight plant oils, and they lather when combined with water. This allows oil cleansers to effectively cleanse away dirt and impurities without stripping or weighing down the skin, making them a great option for those with dry skin types.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use a green tea toner</span>
            <p>Green tea is a great antioxidant for your skin. It helps to calm down any dryness or irritation while keeping your skin looking youthful with its anti-ageing properties.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use a hyaluronic acid serum</span>
            <p>Hyaluronic acid helps skin stretch and flex and reduces skin wrinkles and lines. Hyaluronic acid is best used before a moisturizer as it works as a humectant, which traps moisture in the skin and keeps it from evaporating, especially in dry environments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use a thick moisturizer rich in ceramides and hyaluronic acid</span>
            <p>The hydrating and repairing properties of ceramides, combined with the moisture-trapping hyaluronic acid in a thick moisturizer, is the key to keeping dry skin types looking supple and healthy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Make sure to apply a thick SPF 50+ sunscreen every 3 hours</span>
            <p>Dry skin is more prone to getting sunburnt, which could lead to even flakier skin and more irritation. Sunscreen is essential to maintaining the skin’s health.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="care">
    <h2>How to care for sensitive Skin</h2>
    <img src="images\sensitive.jfif">
   <p>
    Sensitive skin is a condition that makes your skin
    more prone to reactions such as redness and
    itching. Most people who<br> have sensitive skin
    notice occasional or frequent itching, burning,
    and stinging on patches of skin. It’s important to
    focus<br> on strengthening the skin barrier 
    for sensitive skin to avoid getting more issues. Here
    is a skincare routine which focuses <br>on 
    minimizing oiliness and dry patches to get 
    a strong, well nourished skin barrier!
</p>
</div>
<div class="points">
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>Cleanse your face twice a day with a face wash containing squalane</span>
            <p>Squalane mimics the skin’s natural ability to repair and moisturize itself through sebum. It is an organic emollient that helps sensitive skin maintain hydration.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use rosehip oil</span>
            <p>Rosehips are rich in vitamin C, making rosehip oil effective for protecting and repairing the skin. It acts as an antioxidant, shielding cells from damage, reversing sun damage, and addressing signs of aging caused by excessive sun exposure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use a hyaluronic acid serum</span>
            <p>Hyaluronic acid enhances skin elasticity and reduces wrinkles. Best used before moisturizer, it traps moisture in the skin, particularly useful in dry climates.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Use a thick moisturizer rich in ceramides and hyaluronic acid</span>
            <p>Combining ceramides and hyaluronic acid in a moisturizer ensures hydration and repairs dry skin, leaving it supple and healthy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Apply a thick SPF 50+ sunscreen every 3 hours</span>
            <p>Dry skin is more prone to sunburn, causing flakiness and irritation. Regular sunscreen application is essential for maintaining skin health.</p>
