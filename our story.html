    Working on creating Soulful Skincare Guide was a long, yet enjoyable process. To create this project, we first started by brainstorming ideas for a topic we all had passion towards,
     we chose skincare and mental health wellness. Then, each person chose a subtopic and started working on creating a prototype of how we would like the website to look like, we used Figma to collaborate and make sure the pages all look uniform and related to each other. When we were done with creating wireframes, we distributed the tasks for writing the<br>
      HTML for each page and styling it with CSS, we also tasked a member to create the registration form, validate its entries with JavaScript and display the welcome message upon successful submission. We communicated mostly in a group chat, updating each other on each task we had done and giving each other feedback if any improvements were needed and sending the individual files so that the leader can put them all in one folder and stylesheet.<br><br>

A challenge we faced was finding images suitable for the website, as most of the images contain real people, we wanted to find ones that were modest enough and did not have background colors that clashed with our light blue theme. But after a long time of searching for different keywords, we gathered all the necessary images. Once we were done with creating mock-ups, we started to create the pages on HTML and style them using CSS. Coding the pages would have gone a lot smoother if we had a collaborative program that let us work in real time. Each member went their own way styling the content on their external CSS stylesheet, and although we had agreed on the design, each page needed to be adjusted at the end for the scaling of the pages to look the same. Some classes and id names had to be fixed as well to make sure there was not any repeating code in the CSS stylesheet which does the same thing. Also, when we first created scripts for the form’s error messages to appear and the greeting for the name if the form was successfully submitted, we quickly found out that using an external JavaScript file was a more maintainable approach as we would not have to make adjustments in each page and we can just call each function as needed on each page.<br><br>
Some valuable lessons for creating websites were learnt throughout this project. The most important lesson was learning how to manage our time wisely, as it took a while to make amendments to each member’s code while having other tasks, we needed to get done to make the website functional. Another lesson we learnt was to always create a rough sketch of pages before we attempt to create them, we often needed to get out a sheet of paper and a pen to make ideas clearer between us. We learned about the importance of website creating components, HTML defined the structure of our content, CSS determined the style and layout, and JavaScript made the content interactive; therefore, it makes the most sense to learn them in that order. This project was a transformative learning experience. We gained a deeper understanding of web development, covering both technical skills and best practices.

We encountered multiple bugs during the project, especially when working with JavaScript logic and CSS layouts. Learning to use developer tools like the browser console and inspect elements allowed us to quickly identify and fix issues. Debugging also enhanced my problem-solving abilities. We also gained awareness on how a website’s design and functionality must prioritize the user’s experience. Small details like responsive design, easy navigation, and error messages for invalid input can make a big difference. We learned to test the website rigorously to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for users.
