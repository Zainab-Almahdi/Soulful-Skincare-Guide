    <h2>How does stress affect your skin?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>When you feel stressed, your body releases a hormone called cortisol, this breaks down the collagen and elastin in skin, which can speed up the ageing process causing more fine lines and wrinkles. Cortisol also triggers increased oil production which can clog pores and lead to acne breakouts. Fortunately, there are lots of meditation techniques we can use to prevent or manage stress during difficult times.</p>

        <h2>Meditation for skin health</h2>
        <img src="images/meditation.jpg">
        <p>Meditation reduces stress,
            lowering cortisol levels that can
            lead to acne, inflammation, and
            aging.<br> It boosts circulation,
            balances oil production, and
            promotes a natural glow—
            resulting in healthier, clearer skin.
            When you meditate, you
            may clear away the information
            overload that builds up every day 
            and contributes to your stress.
            Here are the best meditation
            techniques that effectively reduce stress!</p>

        <h2>Focused breathing</h2>
        <img  src="images/focused breathing.jfif">
        <p>
            Sometimes, life can get overwhelming to the point where we forget to take deep breathes.<br> 
            Not taking inhales and exhales deep enough increases feelings of anxiety, often making your chest feel heavy.<br> Luckily, focused breathing is the solution to get this weight off your chest.

            <div class="points">
                <ol>
                <lh>Focused breathing involves sitting quietly and focusing on your breath, here is how to do it:</lh>

                <li>Take a comfortable seat, keeping your spine straight.</li>
                <li>Observe the natural inhale and exhale of your breath.</li>
                <li>Start to pay extra attention to the gaps — the spaces between your inhales and exhales. Notice them start to expand.</li>
                <li>Try to keep your body very still and breathe softly.</li>
                <li>If your mind wanders, come back to simply observing the breath.</li>

                <p>
                    Sitting in silence and being minful of your surrounding is the best medicine for when your thoughts get too loud,<br>
                    making you feel like you are not in control of a situation or outcome. Mindful meditation brings you back into the moment<br>
                    and lets you take back control!

                        <lh>This type of meditation involves being present with your thoughts and emotions, helping you to become an observer of your thinking patterns.</lh>
        
                        <li>Either sit in stillness or practice during a repetitive activity such as knitting</li>
                        <li>Focus on your breath, or on each movement of the activity. Focus on the breath, or focus on the activity with intent.</li>
                        <li>Repeat several times, or set an alarm for a specific amount of time.</li>

                            mind, box breathing is a great technique which can effectively get you out of your "fight or flight"<br>
                            nervous system response and get you to relax.

                                <li>Repeat 12 to 15 times or more as needed, and don’t skimp on the “holds.” Those gentle pause points between inhalations and exhalations help cue the nervous system into relaxing.</li>

                                            A common side effect of overthing is having a lack of sleep, which consequently increases stress. A great way to<br>
