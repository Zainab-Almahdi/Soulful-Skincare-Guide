        <p>Soulful Skincare Guide has a simple yet unique logo to give it unique branding for users to recognize it. Good contrast is achieved by using black text on light backgrounds, and white colored text on the hero image for readability and to grab the user’s attention. Images of real people are used to invoke emotion and engagement. “Arial” font is used on all the site because it’s easily readable. The website has a light blue and white minimalistic, as the mind associates the color blue with feelings of calmness and relaxation. The website uses HTML to separate content logically (e.g., headers, paragraphs, sections). The site is designed to maximize developer maintainability for future upgrades by having comments placed in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to explain what it does for the website. The consistent structure of the navigation bar, hero section, and footer are applied to all the pages, making it easy to add new to pages seamlessly. Styling is maintained in a single CSS file which makes it easier to add new pages and make styling changes to the whole website in one place. “Cascading” is used in CSS  so that lower level elements ‘inherit property values from higher level elements, reducing code duplication and making it easier to make changes. Alt text is used for all images in case they can’t be displayed and for compatibility for users that use screen readers.</p>

The registration form has four fields for<br> the user to fill, if the user leaves a section empty the form does the validation<br> to tell the user to fill it, and if the format of the user’s input is not a format that<br> the form accepts, it tells them exactly how to put the right information.<br> When the user registers successfully, the screen scrolls up to a greeting<br> message is displayed to them under the hero section. Methods are used in<br> the JavaScript code to help other developers to extend functionality and maintain<br> the website, meaningful variable and method names are used as well.<br> The home page gives an overview of the subtopics the website contains<br> and what the website is about.
